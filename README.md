# Sensor-Localization
Machine learning code for sensor localization within a single floor of a building.

TODO

Move node finding in find_nodes to its own functions, and change it to incorporate Baye's rule and recursively investigate all possible permutatins of nodes in rooms.

Update probability model from naive room intersection to more intelligent approach.

Update distance model to account for walls.
